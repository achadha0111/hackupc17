# Hackathon Photobooth - Built at HackUPC 2017

We are a team of 4 with about 30 hackathons between us. However, at these hackathons, we have noticed that there has always been one thing missing from these hackathons, a photo booth. So, being the hackers we are, we decided to change that at HackUPC and improvised a photobooth from hardware we had around us. 

# What we used

As first time visitors to Barcelona, 2 of us were carrying DSLR cammeras and there lays our main ingredient. We also had a Raspberry Pi, a USB mic and a speaker. Putting all these together, we hacked the Raspberry Pi to run scripts that are triggered by a Google Home agent, whom we affectionately call Scotty.  These scripts then click photos at predefined intervals and publish them to Twitter, with tags for MLH & Hackathons.
